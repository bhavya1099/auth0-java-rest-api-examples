================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The method hello(Principal principal) returns the name of the authenticated user. If this information is exposed, it could potentially be used for nefarious purposes by malicious actors.
Solution: Avoid returning sensitive information directly. If it's necessary to return the user's name, consider implementing additional security measures, such as encryption or tokenization.

Vulnerability: CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Issue: The application might be vulnerable to CSRF attacks if it doesn't implement any CSRF protection measures. An attacker could trick a victim into executing unwanted actions on a web application in which they're authenticated.
Solution: Implement CSRF protection measures. This could include using anti-CSRF tokens or same-site cookies, and validating the origin of requests.

Vulnerability: CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
Issue: The hello() method does not perform any authentication or authorization checks. This could allow unauthorized users to access this function.
Solution: Ensure that all sensitive operations require authentication and appropriate authorization. Use the @Secured annotation to restrict access to authenticated users or users with specific roles.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful greeting message generation
Details:  
  TestName: testHelloMethodWithValidPrincipal
  Description: This test is meant to check if the hello method successfully generates a greeting message using a valid Principal object. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid Principal object with a name. 
  Act: Invoke the hello method with the created Principal object. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned greeting message with the expected greeting message.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the hello method can successfully generate a greeting message using a valid Principal object. The expected result is the correct greeting message. This test is significant as it confirms the basic functionality of the hello method.

Scenario 2: Null Principal object
Details:  
  TestName: testHelloMethodWithNullPrincipal
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the hello method when it is invoked with a null Principal object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a null Principal object. 
  Act: Invoke the hello method with the null Principal object. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if an appropriate exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the hello method is able to handle null Principal objects by throwing an appropriate exception. This test is significant as it checks the error handling capability of the hello method.

Scenario 3: Empty Principal name
Details:  
  TestName: testHelloMethodWithEmptyPrincipalName
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the hello method when it is invoked with a Principal object that has an empty name.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Principal object with an empty name. 
  Act: Invoke the hello method with the created Principal object. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned greeting message with the expected greeting message.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the hello method can handle Principal objects with empty names by returning a greeting message that does not include a name. This test is significant as it checks the functionality of the hello method with edge case inputs.
