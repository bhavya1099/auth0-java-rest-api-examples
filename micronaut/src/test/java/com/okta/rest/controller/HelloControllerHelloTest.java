================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor
Issue: The Principal.getName() method can expose sensitive user data, as it might return a username or other identifiable information.
Solution: Avoid directly printing sensitive data like names or usernames. If necessary, consider using a unique, non-identifiable user ID instead of the actual name.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: Returning a string with the user's name might give away information about the internal state of the application, such as the user being currently authenticated.
Solution: Consider limiting the amount of information you expose. For instance, you could return a generic greeting without including the user's name.

Vulnerability: CWE-213: Intentional Information Disclosure
Issue: The method hello(Principal principal) is public, meaning it can be called from anywhere, potentially leading to intentional information disclosure.
Solution: Limit the visibility of your methods as much as possible. If this method doesn't need to be public, consider making it private or protected.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful greeting message generation
Details:  
  TestName: testHelloMethodWithValidPrincipal
  Description: This test is meant to check if the hello method successfully generates a greeting message using a valid Principal object. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid Principal object with a name. 
  Act: Invoke the hello method with the created Principal object. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned greeting message with the expected message.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the hello method properly concatenates the Principal's name in the greeting message. The expected result is based on the functionality of the hello method. This test is significant in ensuring that the hello method behaves as expected when provided with valid input.

Scenario 2: Null Principal object
Details:  
  TestName: testHelloMethodWithNullPrincipal
  Description: This test is meant to check how the hello method handles a null Principal object.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is needed as we are testing with a null Principal object.
  Act: Invoke the hello method with a null Principal object. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect a NullPointerException.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the hello method throws a NullPointerException when provided with a null Principal object. This test is crucial in ensuring that the hello method handles null inputs as expected.

Scenario 3: Empty Principal name
Details:  
  TestName: testHelloMethodWithEmptyPrincipalName
  Description: This test is meant to check how the hello method handles a Principal object with an empty name.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Principal object with an empty name. 
  Act: Invoke the hello method with the created Principal object. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned greeting message with the expected message.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the hello method properly handles a Principal object with an empty name. The expected result is based on the functionality of the hello method. This test is important in ensuring that the hello method can handle edge cases.
