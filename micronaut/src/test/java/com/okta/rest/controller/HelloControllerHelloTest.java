ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=hello_be3b337025

Scenario 1: Test with valid Principal
Details:  
  TestName: testHelloWithValidPrincipal.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the hello method with a valid Principal object. It is targeting the normal scenario where the Principal object is not null and has a valid name. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Principal object with a valid name.
  Act: Invoke the hello method with the mock Principal object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned string with the expected greeting string.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the hello method correctly concatenates the Principal's name to the greeting string. The expected result is based on the specified behavior of the hello method. This test is significant as it verifies the correct behavior of the method under normal conditions.

Scenario 2: Test with null Principal
Details:  
  TestName: testHelloWithNullPrincipal.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the hello method when the Principal object is null. It is targeting the error handling scenario where the Principal object is null. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is needed as no Principal object will be used.
  Act: Invoke the hello method with null as the parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect a NullPointerException.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the hello method throws a NullPointerException when the Principal object is null. The expected result is based on the standard behavior of Java methods when they try to access a method or property of a null object. This test is significant as it verifies the correct error handling of the method when the Principal object is null.

Scenario 3: Test with empty Principal name
Details:  
  TestName: testHelloWithEmptyPrincipalName.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the hello method when the Principal object has an empty name. It is targeting the edge case scenario where the Principal object has an empty name. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Principal object with an empty name.
  Act: Invoke the hello method with the mock Principal object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned string with the expected greeting string.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the hello method correctly handles the case where the Principal's name is empty. The expected result is based on the specified behavior of the hello method. This test is significant as it verifies the correct behavior of the method under edge case conditions.
