================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The current method exposes user's principal name which can be sensitive information.
Solution: Avoid exposing sensitive information. If it's necessary, make sure you are using secure communication (HTTPS) and data is properly sanitized.

Vulnerability: CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')
Issue: If the Principal object is not properly sanitized, it can be an attack vector for URL redirection attacks.
Solution: Sanitize user input. Consider using a list of allowed redirection URLs and do not allow any other URLs.

Vulnerability: CWE-285: Improper Authorization
Issue: The method is not secured by any authorization mechanism, which means any authenticated user can access it.
Solution: Implement proper authorization checks before allowing access to the method. You can use annotations such as @Secured or @RolesAllowed to achieve this.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful greeting message generation
Details:  
  TestName: testHelloMethodWithValidPrincipal
  Description: This test is meant to check if the hello method successfully generates a greeting message using a valid Principal object. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid Principal object with a name. 
  Act: Invoke the hello method with the created Principal object. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned greeting message with the expected greeting message.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the hello method can successfully generate a greeting message using a valid Principal object. This test is significant in ensuring the basic functionality of the hello method.

Scenario 2: Principal object with no name
Details:  
  TestName: testHelloMethodWithPrincipalNoName
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the hello method when the Principal object has no name. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Principal object with no name. 
  Act: Invoke the hello method with the created Principal object. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned greeting message with the expected greeting message.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the hello method can handle a Principal object with no name. This test is important for ensuring robust error handling in the hello method.

Scenario 3: Null Principal object
Details:  
  TestName: testHelloMethodWithNullPrincipal
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the hello method when the Principal object is null. 
Execution:
  Arrange: There is no need to arrange any data as the Principal object is null. 
  Act: Invoke the hello method with a null Principal object. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure that the method throws an appropriate exception.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the hello method can handle a null Principal object and throws an appropriate exception. This test is important for ensuring robust error handling in the hello method.
