================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The method hello(Principal principal) returns the name of the authenticated user. If this information is exposed, it could potentially be used for nefarious purposes by malicious actors.
Solution: Avoid returning sensitive information directly. If it's necessary to return the user's name, consider implementing additional security measures, such as encryption or tokenization.

Vulnerability: CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Issue: The application might be vulnerable to CSRF attacks if it doesn't implement any CSRF protection measures. An attacker could trick a victim into executing unwanted actions on a web application in which they're authenticated.
Solution: Implement CSRF protection measures. This could include using anti-CSRF tokens or implementing the Synchronizer Token Pattern.

Vulnerability: CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
Issue: The hello(Principal principal) method does not perform any authentication or authorization checks. This could allow unauthorized users to access this function.
Solution: Ensure that all sensitive operations require authentication and appropriate authorization. Use the @Secured annotation to restrict access to authenticated users only.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test with valid Principal
Details:  
  TestName: testHelloWithValidPrincipal.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the hello method with a valid Principal object. It is targeting the normal scenario where the Principal object is not null and has a valid name. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Principal object with a valid name.
  Act: Invoke the hello method with the mock Principal object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned string with the expected greeting string.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the hello method correctly concatenates the Principal's name to the greeting string. The expected result is a greeting string that includes the Principal's name. This test is significant because it ensures that the hello method behaves as expected under normal conditions.

Scenario 2: Test with null Principal
Details:  
  TestName: testHelloWithNullPrincipal.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the hello method when a null Principal object is passed. It is targeting the edge case where the Principal object is null. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as the Principal object is null.
  Act: Invoke the hello method with a null Principal object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect a NullPointerException.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the hello method throws a NullPointerException when a null Principal object is passed. The expected result is a NullPointerException. This test is significant because it ensures that the hello method handles null inputs correctly.

Scenario 3: Test with empty Principal name
Details:  
  TestName: testHelloWithEmptyPrincipalName.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the hello method when the Principal object has an empty name. It is targeting the edge case where the Principal's name is an empty string. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Principal object with an empty name.
  Act: Invoke the hello method with the mock Principal object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned string with the expected greeting string.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the hello method correctly handles the case where the Principal's name is empty. The expected result is a greeting string that includes an empty name. This test is significant because it ensures that the hello method handles edge cases correctly.
