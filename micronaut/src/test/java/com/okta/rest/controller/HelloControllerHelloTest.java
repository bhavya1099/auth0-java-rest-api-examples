================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The method 'hello' returns a greeting that includes the name of the user. If the Principal object is tampered, it could lead to information disclosure.
Solution: Avoid returning sensitive information in your responses. If it's necessary, ensure the information is properly sanitized and the communication is over a secured channel (HTTPS).

Vulnerability: CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
Issue: There is no explicit authentication mechanism before accessing the 'hello' method. This could potentially allow unauthorized users to access this function.
Solution: Use authentication annotations provided by Micronaut Security, such as '@Secured', to protect your endpoints. Ensure only authenticated users can access this function.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The application might potentially expose private information if the Principal object contains sensitive data.
Solution: Ensure the Principal object does not contain sensitive data. If it does, do not use the 'getName()' method to retrieve it, or ensure that the data is properly encrypted or hashed.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid Principal Object Test

Details:
  TestName: testHelloWithValidPrincipal.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the hello method when a valid Principal object is passed. The target scenario is a valid Principal object with a non-empty name.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid Principal mock object with a non-empty name.
  Act: Invoke hello method with the created Principal object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned string is "Hello, [Principal's name]!".
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the hello method correctly concatenates the Principal's name with the greeting string. This test is significant as it validates the basic functionality of the hello method.

Scenario 2: Null Principal Object Test

Details:
  TestName: testHelloWithNullPrincipal.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the hello method when a null Principal object is passed. The target scenario is a null Principal object.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrange is required as we are passing a null.
  Act: Invoke the hello method with a null Principal object.
  Assert: Assert that a NullPointerException is thrown.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the hello method correctly handles null Principal objects by throwing a NullPointerException. This test is significant as it validates the error handling of the hello method.

Scenario 3: Empty Principal Name Test

Details:
  TestName: testHelloWithEmptyPrincipalName.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the hello method when a Principal object with an empty name is passed. The target scenario is a Principal object with an empty name.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Principal mock object with an empty name.
  Act: Invoke the hello method with the created Principal object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned string is "Hello, !".
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the hello method correctly handles Principal objects with empty names by returning "Hello, !". This test is significant as it validates the edge case handling of the hello method.
