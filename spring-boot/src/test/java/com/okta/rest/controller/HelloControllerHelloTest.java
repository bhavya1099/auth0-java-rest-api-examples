================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) / CWE-639
Issue: Potential for unauthorized access to data by altering the value of the Principal object.
Solution: Implement proper access controls and permission checks for data access. Do not rely solely on user-supplied input (like Principal object) for data access control.

Vulnerability: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) / CWE-79
Issue: If the Principal's name is used in a web context and can be manipulated, it may be possible to inject scripts that can be executed in the user's browser.
Solution: Ensure to escape all user-supplied input that will be displayed back on a webpage. Use a library or function that automatically takes care of this.

Vulnerability: Sensitive Data Exposure / CWE-200
Issue: Exposing the Principal's name could be a privacy concern, depending on the context.
Solution: Ensure to limit the exposure of sensitive data. If the Principal's name is sensitive, consider not sending it or obfuscating it.

"""
Scenario 1: Testing the hello method with a valid principal object

Details:  
  TestName: testHelloWithValidPrincipal
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the hello method when a valid principal object is passed as a parameter. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a principal object with a name.
  Act: Invoke the hello method with the created principal object as a parameter. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected greeting message.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the hello method returns the correct greeting message for the given principal. The expected result is based on the method's business logic of appending the principal's name to the greeting. 

Scenario 2: Testing the hello method with a null principal object

Details:
  TestName: testHelloWithNullPrincipal
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the hello method when a null principal object is passed as a parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: No need to arrange any data as we are passing null as a parameter.
  Act: Invoke the hello method with null as a parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected result.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the hello method handles the null principal object correctly without throwing any exceptions. The expected result is a greeting message without a name appended, based on the method's business logic.

Scenario 3: Testing the hello method with an empty principal name

Details:
  TestName: testHelloWithEmptyPrincipalName
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the hello method when a principal object with an empty name is passed as a parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a principal object with an empty name.
  Act: Invoke the hello method with the created principal object as a parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected result.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the hello method handles the principal object with an empty name correctly. The expected result is a greeting message without a name appended, based on the method's business logic.
