================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) / CWE-639
Issue: Potential for unauthorized access to data by altering the value of the Principal object.
Solution: Implement proper access controls and permission checks for data access. Do not rely solely on user-supplied input (like Principal object) for data access control.

Vulnerability: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) / CWE-79
Issue: If user-supplied data is not properly sanitized, it can lead to Cross-Site Scripting attacks when this data is rendered on the web page.
Solution: Sanitize user-supplied input before rendering it on the web page. Use encoding libraries like OWASP Java Encoder to encode user-supplied data.

Vulnerability: Sensitive Data Exposure / CWE-200
Issue: Principal.getName() might expose sensitive data (like usernames) which can be used in further attacks.
Solution: Limit the amount of information returned by APIs. Avoid returning sensitive data like usernames in API responses.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Test when Principal is provided with a valid name.

Details:  
  TestName: testHelloWithValidPrincipal.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the hello method when a valid Principal object is provided. The Principal object will have a valid non-null name. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Principal object with a valid name.
  Act: Invoke the hello method with the mock Principal object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result with the expected greeting string that includes the name of the Principal.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the hello method returns the correct greeting string when a valid Principal object with a non-null name is provided. This test is significant as it validates the expected behavior of the hello method under normal conditions.

Scenario 2: Test when Principal is provided with a null name.

Details:  
  TestName: testHelloWithNullNamePrincipal.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the hello method when a Principal object with a null name is provided. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Principal object with a null name.
  Act: Invoke the hello method with the mock Principal object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result with the expected greeting string that includes a null string for the name of the Principal.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the hello method returns the correct greeting string when a Principal object with a null name is provided. This test is significant as it validates the expected behavior of the hello method when the Principal's name is null.

Scenario 3: Test when Principal is null.

Details:  
  TestName: testHelloWithNullPrincipal.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the hello method when a null Principal object is provided. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the Principal object to null.
  Act: Invoke the hello method with the null Principal object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect a NullPointerException.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the hello method throws a NullPointerException when a null Principal object is provided. This test is significant as it validates the expected behavior of the hello method when the Principal object is null, thus testing the error handling of the function.
