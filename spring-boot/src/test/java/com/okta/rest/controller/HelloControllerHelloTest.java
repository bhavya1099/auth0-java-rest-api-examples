================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) / CWE-639
Issue: Potential for unauthorized access to data by modifying the value of a reference to an internal implementation object.
Solution: Implement access controls checks or use indirect references to prevent unauthorized access to data.

Vulnerability: Sensitive Data Exposure / CWE-200
Issue: Potential for unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information if Principal object contains sensitive user data.
Solution: Ensure that the Principal object does not contain sensitive data or ensure that sensitive data is properly masked or encrypted.

Vulnerability: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) / CWE-79
Issue: Potential for script injection if user-controlled data is not properly sanitized.
Solution: Use appropriate output encoding libraries to ensure that user-controlled data is properly sanitized before display.

"""
Scenario 1: Test when Principal is provided with a valid name.

Details:  
  TestName: testHelloWithValidPrincipal.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the hello method when a valid Principal object is provided. The Principal object will have a valid non-null and non-empty name. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Principal object with a valid name, e.g., "John".
  Act: Invoke the hello method with the mock Principal object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome, which is "Hello, John!".
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the hello method correctly appends the Principal's name to the greeting. The expected result is based on the method's defined behavior. This test is significant in ensuring that the method correctly processes valid input.

Scenario 2: Test when Principal is provided with a null name.

Details:  
  TestName: testHelloWithNullPrincipalName.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the hello method when a Principal object is provided with a null name. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Principal object with a null name.
  Act: Invoke the hello method with the mock Principal object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome, which is "Hello, null!".
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the hello method correctly handles a null Principal name, appending "null" to the greeting. The expected result is based on the method's defined behavior. This test is significant in checking the method's robustness in handling null input.

Scenario 3: Test when Principal is not provided (null Principal).

Details:  
  TestName: testHelloWithNullPrincipal.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the hello method when a null Principal object is provided. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No need to arrange anything as we are passing null.
  Act: Invoke the hello method with null.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if an appropriate exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the hello method correctly throws an exception when a null Principal object is provided. The expected result is based on the assumption that the method should not accept null input. This test is significant in checking the method's robustness in handling null input.
