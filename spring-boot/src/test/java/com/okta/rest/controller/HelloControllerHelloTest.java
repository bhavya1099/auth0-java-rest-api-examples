================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: The code returns a user's name in the response. If an error occurs, there might be a chance that the error message exposes sensitive information about the user or system.
Solution: Avoid sending sensitive information in response. Implement a global exception handler that catches all exceptions and returns a standard error message.

Vulnerability: CWE-384: Session Fixation
Issue: The code does not seem to manage sessions, and this may make it vulnerable to session fixation attacks if not handled properly in other parts of the application.
Solution: Handle sessions properly. Invalidate the existing user session after login and create a new session.

Vulnerability: CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Issue: Without proper CSRF protection, the application might be vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
Solution: Use anti-CSRF tokens in forms, or use the Synchronizer Token Pattern. Many frameworks have built-in support for CSRF protection.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for Valid Principal

Details:
  TestName: testHelloWithValidPrincipal
  Description: This test aims to verify the functionality of the hello method when provided with a valid Principal object. The target scenario is when a legitimate Principal object is passed to the method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Principal object with a predefined name.
  Act: Invoke the hello method with the mock Principal object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned string matches the expected greeting.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly constructs and returns the greeting using the name from the Principal object. This test is significant as it checks the primary functionality of the hello method.

Scenario 2: Test for Null Principal

Details:
  TestName: testHelloWithNullPrincipal
  Description: This test aims to verify the behavior of the hello method when a null Principal object is passed. The target scenario is when a null Principal object is passed to the method.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is needed as we are passing a null.
  Act: Invoke the hello method with null as the Principal object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned string matches the expected output.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method handles the null Principal object gracefully without throwing an exception. This test is significant as it checks the robustness of the hello method.

Scenario 3: Test for Empty Principal Name

Details:
  TestName: testHelloWithEmptyPrincipalName
  Description: This test aims to verify the behavior of the hello method when the Principal object has an empty name. The target scenario is when a Principal object with an empty name is passed to the method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Principal object with an empty name.
  Act: Invoke the hello method with the mock Principal object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned string matches the expected output.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method handles the Principal object with an empty name gracefully and returns the expected output. This test is significant as it checks the robustness of the hello method.

Scenario 4: Test for Special Characters in Principal Name

Details:
  TestName: testHelloWithSpecialCharactersInPrincipalName
  Description: This test aims to verify the behavior of the hello method when the Principal object's name contains special characters. The target scenario is when a Principal object with a name containing special characters is passed to the method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Principal object with a name containing special characters.
  Act: Invoke the hello method with the mock Principal object.
  Assert: Assert that the returned string matches the expected output.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method handles the Principal object with a name containing special characters gracefully and returns the expected output. This test is significant as it checks the robustness of the hello method.
