ROOST_METHOD_HASH=hello_7b02812cc7
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=hello_be3b337025

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Input Validation (CWE-20)
Issue: The code is directly using the user-provided value (principal.getName()) without any validation. This could lead to potential issues if the Principal object is null or tampered with.
Solution: Before using the user-provided value, perform null-check and apply necessary input validation techniques to ensure the data is safe to use.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Test when Principal is provided with a valid name.

Details:  
  TestName: testHelloWithValidPrincipal.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the hello method when a valid Principal object is provided. The Principal object will have a valid non-null name. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a Principal object with a valid name. 
  Act: Invoke the hello method with the Principal object as a parameter. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned string with the expected greeting.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the hello method correctly appends the Principal's name to the greeting string. This test is significant as it checks the basic functionality of the hello method with valid input.

Scenario 2: Test when Principal is provided with an empty name.

Details:  
  TestName: testHelloWithEmptyPrincipalName.
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the hello method when an empty string is provided as the Principal's name.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a Principal object with an empty string as the name. 
  Act: Invoke the hello method with the Principal object as a parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned string with the expected greeting.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the hello method correctly handles an empty string as the Principal's name. This test is significant as it checks the behavior of the hello method when given potentially problematic input.

Scenario 3: Test when Principal is null.

Details:  
  TestName: testHelloWithNullPrincipal.
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the hello method when a null Principal object is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Declare a Principal object as null.
  Act: Invoke the hello method with the null Principal object as a parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect a NullPointerException.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the hello method throws a NullPointerException when a null Principal object is provided. This test is important as it checks the method's error handling capabilities.
