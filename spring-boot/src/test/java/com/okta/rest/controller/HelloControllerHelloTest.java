================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The method hello() is publicly accessible and it returns the name of the Principal. This can lead to possible information exposure.
Solution: Consider limiting the access to the method or obfuscating sensitive information before returning it.

Vulnerability: CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Method or Function
Issue: The hello() function is declared as public and can be accessed from outside of its class, potentially exposing sensitive information or functionality.
Solution: Consider making the hello() function private or protected, or ensure that any sensitive operations within it are properly secured.

Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: Using GET request to transmit sensitive information can lead to information leakage as it can be cached in browser history, server logs, or intermediary proxies.
Solution: Avoid sending sensitive information over GET request. Use POST request instead.

"""
Scenario 1: Test when Principal is provided with a valid name.

Details:  
  TestName: testHelloWithValidPrincipal.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the hello method when a valid Principal object is provided. The Principal object will have a valid non-null and non-empty name. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Principal object with a valid name, e.g. "John".
  Act: Invoke the hello method with the mock Principal object. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome, which should be "Hello, John!".
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the hello method correctly constructs a greeting message using the name from the Principal object. This test is significant as it checks the basic functionality of the hello method.
  
Scenario 2: Test when Principal is null.

Details:  
  TestName: testHelloWithNullPrincipal.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the hello method when a null Principal object is provided. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the Principal object as null.
  Act: Invoke the hello method with the null Principal object. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to anticipate a NullPointerException.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the hello method throws a NullPointerException when the Principal object is null. This test is significant as it checks the error handling capability of the hello method.

Scenario 3: Test when Principal has an empty name.

Details:  
  TestName: testHelloWithEmptyPrincipalName.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the hello method when the Principal object has an empty name. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Principal object with an empty name.
  Act: Invoke the hello method with the mock Principal object. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome, which should be "Hello, !".
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the hello method correctly constructs a greeting message even when the Principal object has an empty name. This test is significant as it checks the robustness of the hello method.
  
Scenario 4: Test when Principal has a name with special characters.

Details:  
  TestName: testHelloWithSpecialCharactersInPrincipalName.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the hello method when the Principal object has a name with special characters. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Principal object with a name containing special characters, e.g. "@John#".
  Act: Invoke the hello method with the mock Principal object. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome, which should be "Hello, @John#!".
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the hello method correctly constructs a greeting message even when the Principal object has a name with special characters. This test is significant as it checks the robustness of the hello method.
