================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) / CWE-639
Issue: Potential for unauthorized access to data by altering the ID value of a resource.
Solution: Implement access control checks or use GUIDs as resource IDs to prevent guessing/brute-forcing.

Vulnerability: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) / CWE-79
Issue: If user input is not properly sanitized, an attacker can inject malicious scripts.
Solution: Use output encoding libraries when displaying user-generated content.

Vulnerability: SQL Injection / CWE-89
Issue: If user input is included in SQL queries without proper sanitization, an attacker can manipulate the queries.
Solution: Use PreparedStatement, Hibernate, or JPQL which supports parameterized queries.

Scenario 1: Test when Principal is provided with a valid name

Details:  
  TestName: testHelloWithValidPrincipal.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the hello method when a valid Principal object is provided. The Principal object will have a valid non-null name. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Principal object with a valid name.
  Act: Invoke the hello method with the mock Principal object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result with the expected greeting string that includes the Principal's name.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the hello method correctly concatenates the Principal's name into the greeting string. This test is significant as it checks the basic functionality of the hello method.

Scenario 2: Test when Principal is null

Details:  
  TestName: testHelloWithNullPrincipal.
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the hello method when null is passed as the Principal. This targets the scenario where the user is not authenticated, and there is no Principal object.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement necessary as no Principal object is required.
  Act: Invoke the hello method with null as the Principal.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to anticipate a NullPointerException.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the hello method throws a NullPointerException when the Principal is null. It's important to ensure that the application can gracefully handle null values.

Scenario 3: Test when Principal has an empty name

Details:  
  TestName: testHelloWithEmptyNamePrincipal.
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the hello method when the Principal's name is an empty string. This targets the scenario where the user's name is not available or empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock Principal object with an empty name.
  Act: Invoke the hello method with the mock Principal object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result with the expected greeting string that has a trailing comma and space, as the name is empty.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the hello method correctly handles the scenario where the Principal's name is empty. It's significant to ensure that the method can handle edge cases like an empty name.
