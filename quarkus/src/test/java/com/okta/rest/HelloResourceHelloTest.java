================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: The code exposes the username of the user in an error message. This could potentially allow an attacker to gather valid usernames to use in further attacks.
Solution: It's recommended to return generic error messages or to log the user-specific details instead of presenting them to the user. This way, the sensitive information is not revealed to potential attackers.

Vulnerability: CWE-285: Improper Authorization
Issue: The code does not check if the authenticated user has the right permissions to access a resource or execute an operation.
Solution: Ensure that after authentication, proper authorization checks are performed according to the principle of least privilege. This means users should only be able to access resources or execute operations that they're permitted to.

Vulnerability: CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
Issue: The code might have hard-coded credentials if the getUserPrincipal() method is implemented in such a way that it retrieves a hard-coded user.
Solution: Avoid hard-coding credentials in your application. Instead, use environment variables, secure configuration files, or a secure credential management system to store and retrieve sensitive information like usernames and passwords.

"""
  Scenario 1: Successful Authentication and User Greeting

  Details:  
    TestName: testSuccessfulUserGreeting.
    Description: This test is meant to check the successful retrieval of user principal from the security context and the correct formatting of the greeting message. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the SecurityContext and Principal to return a predefined username.
    Act: Invoke the hello method with the mocked SecurityContext.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to validate that the returned message is correctly formatted and includes the predefined username.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the hello method correctly retrieves the username from the Principal and constructs the greeting message. This is important to ensure that authenticated users are correctly identified and greeted.

  Scenario 2: Null User Principal

  Details:  
    TestName: testNullUserPrincipal.
    Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the hello method when the SecurityContext does not contain a user principal. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the SecurityContext to return null when getUserPrincipal() is called.
    Act: Invoke the hello method with the mocked SecurityContext.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to validate that the returned message is "Hello, null!".
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the hello method correctly handles a null user principal. This is important for ensuring robustness against potential null pointer exceptions.

  Scenario 3: Empty User Principal Name

  Details:  
    TestName: testEmptyUserPrincipalName.
    Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the hello method when the Principal's name is an empty string. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the SecurityContext and Principal to return an empty string as the username.
    Act: Invoke the hello method with the mocked SecurityContext.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to validate that the returned message is "Hello, !".
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the hello method correctly handles an empty user principal name. This is important for ensuring that the method can handle unexpected input data.
