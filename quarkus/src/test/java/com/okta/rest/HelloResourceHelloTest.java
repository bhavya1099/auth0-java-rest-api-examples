================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The method hello(@Context SecurityContext context) is exposing the user's principal name which can lead to information disclosure. An attacker might use this information to perform targeted attacks.
Solution: Avoid returning sensitive information in your responses. If you need to identify the user, consider using a non-sensitive, unique identifier instead of a principal name.

Vulnerability: CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function
Issue: The hello method does not have any authentication or authorization checks, meaning anyone can call this method and get user information.
Solution: Ensure that all methods, especially those that access sensitive information, have proper authentication and authorization checks. For instance, you could use annotations such as @RolesAllowed or @PermitAll.

Vulnerability: CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')
Issue: If the userPrincipal is derived from user input, it might be possible to inject malicious content, leading to an open redirect vulnerability.
Solution: Ensure to validate and sanitize user inputs. Do not directly concatenate user inputs into the response. Use a safe API to construct the response.

"""
  Scenario 1: Successful Hello Message Generation

  Details:  
    TestName: testHelloMessageGeneration.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the hello method successfully generates a hello message by fetching the name of the user principal from the provided SecurityContext. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock a SecurityContext and a Principal object, setting the name of the Principal to a known value.
    Act: Invoke the hello method with the mocked SecurityContext.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected hello message.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify if the hello method can correctly fetch the name of the user principal from the SecurityContext and use it to generate the expected hello message. This is significant in ensuring that the method correctly acknowledges the user.

  Scenario 2: Null SecurityContext Test

  Details:  
    TestName: testNullSecurityContext.
    Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the hello method when provided with a null SecurityContext.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the SecurityContext to null.
    Act: Invoke the hello method with the null SecurityContext.
    Assert: Expect a NullPointerException and use JUnit assertions to confirm if it's thrown.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify if the hello method correctly handles a null SecurityContext by throwing a NullPointerException. This is significant in ensuring that the method safeguards against null input.

  Scenario 3: Null User Principal Test

  Details:  
    TestName: testNullUserPrincipal.
    Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the hello method when the provided SecurityContext has a null user principal.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock a SecurityContext with a null user principal.
    Act: Invoke the hello method with the mocked SecurityContext.
    Assert: Expect a NullPointerException and use JUnit assertions to confirm if it's thrown.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify if the hello method correctly handles a SecurityContext with a null user principal by throwing a NullPointerException. This is significant in ensuring that the method safeguards against invalid input.

  Scenario 4: Empty User Principal Name Test

  Details:  
    TestName: testEmptyUserPrincipalName.
    Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the hello method when the name of the user principal in the provided SecurityContext is empty.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock a SecurityContext and a Principal object, setting the name of the Principal to an empty string.
    Act: Invoke the hello method with the mocked SecurityContext.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected hello message with an empty name.
  Validation: 
    This assertion aims to verify if the hello method can correctly handle an empty user principal name and still generate the expected hello message. This is significant in ensuring that the method correctly handles edge cases.
