================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-285: Improper Authorization
Issue: The function `hello` does not perform any authorization checks before accessing the user's principal. This can allow unauthorized users to access information or perform actions they shouldn't have access to.
Solution: Implement proper authorization checks to ensure that the user has the appropriate permissions to perform the action. This can be achieved by using role-based access control (RBAC) or any other access control mechanism suitable for the application.

Vulnerability: CWE-501: Trust Boundary Violation
Issue: The function `hello` trusts the `SecurityContext` provided by the user. This can lead to trust boundary violation if the `SecurityContext` is manipulated by the user.
Solution: Validate the `SecurityContext` before using it. This can be done by checking if the `SecurityContext` is null and if the user principal obtained from it is valid. Always sanitize and validate user input.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: The function `hello` returns the user's principal name. If this information is sensitive, it can lead to privacy violation.
Solution: Avoid exposing sensitive user information. If it's necessary to return the user's name, consider returning a pseudonym or a non-sensitive identifier instead.

================================================================================
"""
  Scenario 1: Successful retrieval of the user's name from the SecurityContext

  Details:  
    TestName: testSuccessfulRetrievalOfUserName.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the hello method retrieves the user's name correctly from the SecurityContext when a valid user is logged in.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the SecurityContext and the Principal objects. Set the Principal's name to a known value.
    Act: Invoke the hello method with the mocked SecurityContext.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned string matches the expected greeting.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the method correctly constructs a greeting using the name from the Principal object. This is significant as it ensures that the application correctly recognizes and greets the user.

  Scenario 2: Handling of null SecurityContext

  Details:  
    TestName: testNullSecurityContext.
    Description: This test is meant to check how the hello method handles a null SecurityContext.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the SecurityContext to null.
    Act: Invoke the hello method with the null SecurityContext.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check for any exceptions or error messages.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the method handles a null SecurityContext gracefully, either by returning an appropriate error message or by not throwing an exception. This is significant as it ensures that the application can handle unexpected input without crashing.

  Scenario 3: Handling of null Principal in the SecurityContext

  Details:  
    TestName: testNullPrincipalInSecurityContext.
    Description: This test is meant to check how the hello method handles a SecurityContext with a null Principal.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the SecurityContext to return a null Principal.
    Act: Invoke the hello method with the mocked SecurityContext.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check for any exceptions or error messages.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the method handles a null Principal gracefully, either by returning an appropriate error message or by not throwing an exception. This is significant as it ensures that the application can handle situations where the user is not logged in or their details are not available.
