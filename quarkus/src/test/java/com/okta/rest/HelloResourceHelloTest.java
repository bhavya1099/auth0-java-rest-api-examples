================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-285: Improper Authorization
Issue: The code does not perform any authorization checks to determine if the authenticated user has the necessary permissions to access the functionality. This could lead to unauthorized access to protected resources.
Solution: Apply appropriate authorization checks to ensure that the authenticated user has the necessary permissions to access the requested resource. Use role-based access control (RBAC) or similar mechanisms to enforce authorization.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: The code does not handle potential exceptions that may occur when retrieving the user principal from the context. If an exception occurs, the default error message may reveal sensitive information about the system.
Solution: Implement proper exception handling to catch potential exceptions and return custom error messages that do not reveal sensitive information about the system.

Vulnerability: CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')
Issue: If the 'userPrincipal.getName()' method returns a URL, this could lead to an open redirection vulnerability, where the application redirects the user to an untrusted external site.
Solution: Sanitize and validate the output of 'userPrincipal.getName()' method to ensure it does not return a URL or any other untrusted data.

"""
  Scenario 1: Successful retrieval of the user's name from the SecurityContext

  Details:  
    TestName: testSuccessfulRetrievalOfUserName.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the hello method retrieves the user's name correctly from the SecurityContext when a valid user is logged in.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the SecurityContext and the Principal class to return a valid user name.
    Act: Invoke the hello method with the mocked SecurityContext.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual returned string with the expected string.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the hello method correctly retrieves the user's name from the SecurityContext and formats it correctly in the returned string. This is significant in ensuring that the user is correctly authenticated and their name is correctly displayed.

  Scenario 2: Error handling when there is no user logged in

  Details:  
    TestName: testErrorHandlingWithNoUser.
    Description: This test is meant to check how the hello method handles the situation when there is no user logged in (i.e., getUserPrincipal returns null).
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the SecurityContext to return null when getUserPrincipal is invoked.
    Act: Invoke the hello method with the mocked SecurityContext.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the correct error is thrown.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the hello method correctly handles the situation when there is no user logged in. This is significant in ensuring that the application behaves correctly when there is no authenticated user.

  Scenario 3: Error handling when the SecurityContext is null

  Details:  
    TestName: testErrorHandlingWithNullSecurityContext.
    Description: This test is meant to check how the hello method handles the situation when the SecurityContext passed to it is null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Pass a null SecurityContext to the hello method.
    Act: Invoke the hello method with the null SecurityContext.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the correct error is thrown.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the hello method correctly handles the situation when the SecurityContext is null. This is significant in ensuring that the application behaves correctly when there is no SecurityContext.
